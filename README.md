# Stenography
A image stenography tool made as a task for GCI.

The program currently supports character input ranged between [A-Z][a-z], space( ) and full stop(.).
However it converts all letters in upper case to lower case.

The Program.py is the main program which does encryption and decryption.
The img.png is a normal image used while testing.
The img_processed.png is the result file which was created from img.png and message "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
