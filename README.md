# Stenography
A image stenography tool made as a task for GCI.

The program currently supports character input ranged between [A-Z][a-z], space( ), comma(,), question mark(?) and full stop(.).
However it converts all letters in upper case to lower case.

The Program.py is the main program which does encryption and decryption.
The img.png is a normal image used while testing.
The img_processed.png is the result file which was created from img.png and message "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

The .cast file is the asciinema file. And image.png is the image which was encrypted with the message during its recording. image_processed.png is the file which is the result of the encryption process. Later the same file is decrypted to get the message back.
